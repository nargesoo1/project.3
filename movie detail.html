    <p>Movie Title</p>
    <p id="text"> The Indian movie Bahubali is a very popular and exciting film that showcases its stunning visuals and grand budget. The story revolves around a king named Bahubali who bravely defends his kingdom against enemies with countless courage and faith. While I can't provide a very brief summary of such an extraordinary film, I can say that Bahubali is an amazing blend of action, fantasy, and emotions that captivates viewers with excitement and entertainment.
        I suggest watching the movie yourself to enjoy all its details and beauties.</p>
